# MediaTypes

From Umbraco 8.14 the new Media Picker (v3) has been added. A number of new MediaTypes and DataTypes have also been added. Unfortunately, these MediaTypes are not added automatically if you upgrade from an older version. In this repo you will find uSync definitions of these types so that you can easily add them.
